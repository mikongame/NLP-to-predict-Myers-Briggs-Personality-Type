## Project Description
In order to learn more on NLP while applaying its methods to psychological variables I have been working on this dataset from Kaggle, [(MBTI) Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type) which holds information on a forum's users' posts and personalities using MBTI.

## Objective
The IT labour market is getting more and more competitive, as there is more demmand than offer of proffesionals. And of course, eveywane wants the best of the best for their company.

Finding the best talent and ensuring they culturally fit in their organizations means a lot of time, effort and money to invest in material, softwere and personality, intelligence and competency measures for Recruitment Teams; even when they have increasingly amount sof candidates' information.

I want to shorten recruitment times and costs in psichometric tests.

So starting with personality tests I pretend to train a model to use text we get from candidates (social networks, cover letters, CV, etc).

To sum up, in this project I want to train a **classification model using text data features and meta-features from each user comments, messages and posts to predict their personalities**.

## Dataset
I have been working on this dataset from Kaggle, [(MBTI) Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type), that holds data collected through the [PersonalityCafe forum](http://personalitycafe.com/forum/), as it provides a large selection of people and their MBTI personality type, as well as what they have written. 

### Workflow
### Exploratory Data Analysis
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did as well as your reasoning behind the process.

### Preprocessing
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

### Models Training and Evaluation
#### Machine Learning Models
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.
#### Deep Learning Models
#### Fine tuning of the best model

### Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the questions you try to answer.

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.


## Tools and requirements
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?
